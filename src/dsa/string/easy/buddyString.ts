/*

Given two strings s and goal, return true if you can swap two letters in s so the result is equal to goal, otherwise, return false.

Swapping letters is defined as taking two indices i and j (0-indexed) such that i != j and swapping the characters at s[i] and s[j].

For example, swapping at indices 0 and 2 in "abcd" results in "cbad".

Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
Explanation: You can swap s[0] = 'a' and s[1] = 'b' to get "ba", which is equal to goal.

export const buddyStrings = (s: string, goal: string) => {
  console.log(s, goal);
};

console.log(buddyStrings("ab", "ba"));
