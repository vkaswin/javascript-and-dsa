/*

You are given a string s consisting of digits and an integer k.

A round can be completed if the length of s is greater than k. In one round, do the following:

Divide s into consecutive groups of size k such that the first k characters are in the first group, the next k characters are in the second group, and so on. Note that the size of the last group can be smaller than k.
Replace each group of s with a string representing the sum of all its digits. For example, "346" is replaced with "13" because 3 + 4 + 6 = 13.
Merge consecutive groups together to form a new string. If the length of the string is greater than k, repeat from step 1.
Return s after all rounds have been completed.

Input: s = "11111222223", k = 3
Output: "135"
Explanation: 
- For the first round, we divide s into groups of size 3: "111", "112", "222", and "23".
  ​​​​​Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3, 1 + 1 + 2 = 4, 2 + 2 + 2 = 6, and 2 + 3 = 5. 
  So, s becomes "3" + "4" + "6" + "5" = "3465" after the first round.
- For the second round, we divide s into "346" and "5".
  Then we calculate the digit sum of each group: 3 + 4 + 6 = 13, 5 = 5. 
  So, s becomes "13" + "5" = "135" after second round. 
Now, s.length <= k, so we return "135" as the answer.

export const digitSum = (s: string, k: number): string => {
  if (s.length <= k) return s;

  let str = "";
  let left = 0;
  let right = 0;
  let sum = null;

  while (right < s.length) {
    if (sum === null) sum = +s[right++];
    else sum += +s[right++];

    if (right - left === k) {
      str += sum;
      sum = null;
      left = right;
    }
  }

  if (sum !== null) str += sum;

  return digitSum(str, k);
};

console.log(digitSum("11111222223", 3));
